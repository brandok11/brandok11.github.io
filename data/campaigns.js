			title: 'Predatory Equity',
			id: 'predatory-equity',
			desc: 'This campaign was a battle against incredibly aggressive real estate speculation. Predatory Equity is an investment scheme which entails local speculative landlords teaming up with huge institutional investors. Predatory Equity landlords and investors purchase massive amounts of rent regulated property and seek to turn out the rent regulated tenants. Their efforts are designed to replace rent regulated tenants with tenants paying significantly higher rents and garner unthinkably high profits. New York City’s campaign against this devious form of investment saw tenants and organizers squared off against some of the largest international banks and investment funds. Brandon’s role in this battle was to educate and organize the tenants of the Lower East Side affected by Predatory Equity. He was able to connect hundreds of tenants to the citywide effort to combat this form of investing.',

Real Time Enforcement would be an enforcement mechanism allowing the Department of Building to pay special attention to buildings that have either one of these conditions.

			desc: 'This citywide campaign against illegal hotels is a campaign to reform the housing laws in New York City to prevent the units in buildings from being illegally converted to youth hostels, guest suites, and other short-term rentals. These conversions almost always come at the expense of the long-term tenants, who landlords often attempt to kick out in an effort to accommodate the lucrative short-term guests. Brandon has organized the tenants of the Lower East Side affected by this issue. His work has connected them to the larger citywide campaign to eliminate illegal hotels.',
